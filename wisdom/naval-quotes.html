<h1>Naval Ravikant Quotes</h1>

<ul>
	<li>"Forty hour workweeks are a relic of the Industrial Age. Knowledge workers function like athletes -- train and sprint, then rest and reassess."</li>
	<li>"A fit body, a calm mind, a house full of love. These things cannot be bought -- they must be earned."</li>
	<li>"Information is everywhere but its meaning is created by the observer that interprets it. Meaning is relative and there is no objective, over-arching meaning."</li>
	<li>"If you’re more passionate about founding a business than the business itself, you can fall into a ten year trap. Better to stay emotionally unattached and select the best opportunity that arises. Applies to relationships too."</li>

	<li>"The secret to public speaking is to speak as if you were alone."</li>
	<li>"Sophisticated foods are bittersweet (wine, beer, coffee, chocolate). Addictive relationships are cooperative and competitive. Work becomes flow at the limits of ability. The flavor of life is on the edge."</li>
	<li>"Technology is not only the thing that moves the human race forward, but it’s the only thing that ever has. Without technology, we’re just monkeys playing in the dirt."</li>

	<li>"Don’t debate people in the media when you can debate them in the marketplace."</li>
	<li>"A contrarian isn’t one who always objects -- that’s a confirmist of a different sort. A contrarian reasons independently, from the ground up, and resists pressure to conform."</li>
	<li>"The real struggle isn’t proletariat vs bourgeois. It’s between high-status elites and wealthy elites. When their cooperation breaks, revolution."</li>

	<li>"Before you can lie to another, you must first lie to yourself."</li>
	<li>"Wealth creation is an evolutionarily recent positive-sum game. Status is an old zero-sum game. Those attacking wealth creation are often just seeking status."</li>
	<li>"Even today, what to study and how to study it are more important than where to study it and for how long. The best teachers are on the Internet. The best books are on the Internet. The best peers are on the Internet. The tools for learning are abundant. It’s the desire to learn that’s scarce."</li>
	<li>"This is such a short and precious life that it’s really important that you don’t spend it being unhappy."</li>

	<li>"You can change it, you can accept it, or you can leave it. What is not a good option is to sit around wishing you would change it but not changing it, wishing you would leave it but not leaving it, and not accepting it. It’s that struggle, that aversion, that is responsible for most of our misery. The phrase that I use the most to myself in my head is one word: accept."</li>
	<li>"I don’t have time is just saying it’s not a priority."</li>
	<li>"Happiness is a state where nothing is missing."</li>

	<li>"If being ethical were profitable everybody would do it."</li>
